## About update and release
This project is not my job, I can only maintain it in my free time

The files in Relsase will contain more features to help protect yourself from being cracked. This also means that their code is not exactly the same as the open source version, but most of the technology is transparent and universal.

The open source project does not contain the kernel code, but I will provide the compiled binary file in Release.

If you have any suggestions, please let me know
